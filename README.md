# CPU-Scheduling
Implementation of various CPU Scheduling algorithms

Implemented algorithms are

1. FCFS (first come first serve scheduling)
2. PS (priority scheduling)
3. RR (round robin scheduling)
4. MLFQ (multilevel feedback queue)
5. SJF-NP (shortest job first- non-preemptive scheduling)
6. SJF-P (shortest job first preemptive scheduling)
